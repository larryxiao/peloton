/*
 * To speed up bulk releasing or reassigning locks from a resource owner to
 * its parent, each resource owner has a small cache of locks it owns. The
 * lock manager has the same information in its local lock hash table, and
 * we fall back on that if cache overflows, but traversing the hash table
 * is slower when there are a lot of locks belonging to other resource owners.
 *
 * MAX_RESOWNER_LOCKS is the size of the per-resource owner cache. It's
 * chosen based on some testing with pg_dump with a large schema. When the
 * tests were done (on 9.2), resource owners in a pg_dump run contained up
 * to 9 locks, regardless of the schema size, except for the top resource
 * owner which contained much more (overflowing the cache). 15 seems like a
 * nice round number that's somewhat higher than what pg_dump needs. Note that
 * making this number larger is not free - the bigger the cache, the slower
 * it is to release locks (in retail), when a resource owner holds many locks.
